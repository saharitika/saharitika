### Ritika Saha
I am an aspiring data scientist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I am a study enthusiast and love to learn new stuff.
My passion lies in solving mental health problems with help of Neuroscience psychology. Some technologies I enjoy working with include data science, AI, ML and AWS. I'm a B.tech undergrad who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community.
